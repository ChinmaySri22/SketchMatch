##Programming Language:
Python: Used for implementing the project.
Libraries and Frameworks:
OpenCV:
Used for image processing tasks such as feature extraction, image restoration, and transformations.
NumPy:
Used for numerical operations, array manipulation, and computations.
Matplotlib:
Used for data visualization and plotting performance metrics.
Algorithms and Techniques:
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform):
For feature detection and descriptor computation.
FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbours):
For efficient feature matching between sketches and images.
CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization):
For enhancing image contrast in the luminance channel.
RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus):
For robust homography estimation to refine matches.
LAB Color Space Transformation:
Used for separating luminance and chrominance components for effective restoration.
Tools and Platforms:
CUHK Face Sketch Database (CUFS):
Dataset for sketches and corresponding original images.
Metrics and Evaluation:
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index):
To evaluate perceptual similarity between restored and original images.
MSE (Mean Squared Error):
For quantifying restoration accuracy.
Additional Tools:
Custom Python Scripts:
For automating data handling, analysis, and evaluation.
